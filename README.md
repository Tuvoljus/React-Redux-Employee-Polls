# Getting Started with "Employee Poll"

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tuvoljus/React-Redux-Employee-Polls.git
$ cd Employee-Poll-React_Final_Project/
$ yarn
```

You can also use npm for create packages

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tuvoljus/React-Redux-Employee-Polls.git
$ cd Employee-Poll-React_Final_Project/
$ npm install
```

Please just one of the package managers! Wheter yarn or npm, not both!

## Launch project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`, yarn is prefered

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. (if port 3000 is available)

The page will reload when you make changes.\

For Testing scripts, please use "yarn jest"!

### Testing `yarn jest`

I use react-testing-library with jest

```
$ yarn jest
```

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

### Deployment

### `yarn run build` fails to minify
